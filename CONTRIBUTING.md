# How to contribute to this project?

Nohow. There is no way you can suggest your pieces of code or any other kind of help, because I want this project to be made only by myself. All pull requests will be denied. The reason why this repository is public is to show it doesn't contain any malicious scripts, which can harm your device.

# Is it allowed to create forks?

Yes, of course. You can fork this repository and make your own version of this game, if you want.
